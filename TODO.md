**TODO:**

github doesn't have a TODO list, and I don't feel like making it on issues, so here's a todo list for this project:

* Update Nuget to this repo
* support more HTML tags, especially the ones Markdown uses
* Fix designer support; It used to work when MacawNL had the xslt set to embedded resource, but I couldn't get that to work for UWP
